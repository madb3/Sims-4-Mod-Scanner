# Sims4-Mod-Scanner

### As an avid Sims 4 player, I often run into the problem of custom content becoming incompatible due to constant game updates and patches. In order to keep my game running smoothly, I created this Mod Scanner as a way to identify broken mods and custom content based on specific file criteria.

### Objectives:
#### - Read filenames
#### - Inspects package metadata
#### - Detects outdated versions
#### - Displays flagged files


### Tools:
#### **Python**: Core logic and file system scanning
#### **ttkbootstrap**: GUI framework
#### **tkinter**: Styling for widgets


### Future add-ons:
#### - Improve UX/UI
#### - Release a published version that can be used by the Sims community


### Privacy:
#### - Program will only analyze game files provided by the user
#### - Does NOT include EA code or modify Sims 4 game files
#### - Works externally
