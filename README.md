# Sims-4-Mod-Scanner

As an avid Sims 4 player, I often run into the problem of custom content becoming incompatible due to constant game updates and patches. In order to keep my game running smoothly, I created this Mod Scanner as a way to identify broken mods and custom content based on specific file criteria.

### Objectives:
* Read filenames
* Inspect package metadata
* Detect outdated versions
* Display flagged files


### Tools:
* **Python**: Core logic and file system scanning
* **ttkbootstrap**: GUI framework
* **tkinter**: Styling for widgets


### Future add-ons:
1. Improve UX/UI
2. Release a published version that can be used by the Sims community


### Privacy:
The program will only analyze game files provided by the user. It does NOT include EA code or modify Sims 4 game files and works externally.
