# Sims-4-Mod-Scanner

### As an avid Sims 4 player, I often run into the problem of custom content becoming incompatible due to constant game updates and patches. In order to keep my game running smoothly, I created this Mod Scanner as a way to identify broken mods and custom content based on specific file criteria.

### Future add-ons:
#### - Improve UX/UI
#### - An option to automatically delete files and/or move them into a separate folder
#### - Release a version that can be downloaded and used by the Sims community
